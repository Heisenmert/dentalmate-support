                <div class="last-updated">
                    <strong>App Version:</strong> 1.0 | <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 20, 2026
                </div>

                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>DentalMate is designed to be intuitive from the first launch. Here's how to get started:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Add Your First Patient:</strong> Tap the Patients tab → "+" icon → Fill in patient details</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule an Appointment:</strong> Tap the Schedule tab → "+" icon → Select patient and time</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable Notifications:</strong> Go to Notifications tab → Allow Notifications</li>
                    <li><strong>View Statistics:</strong> Tap the Statistics tab to see practice insights</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                <h4>How do I backup my data?</h4>
                <p>Your data automatically syncs to iCloud if you're signed in with your Apple ID. Make sure iCloud is enabled in Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud. Your data will transfer seamlessly when you upgrade to a new iPhone.</p>

                <h4>Are my patient notes secure?</h4>
                <p>Yes! All clinical notes are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption, the same standard used by banks and hospitals. The encryption key is stored securely in your iPhone's Keychain and syncs via iCloud Keychain.</p>

                <h4>What happens to photos when I upgrade my iPhone?</h4>
                <p>Patient photos are included in your iCloud backup by default, so they transfer to your new device automatically. If you prefer to keep photos local only, you can disable iCloud backup for DentalMate in Settings.</p>

                <h4>Can I use DentalMate on multiple devices?</h4>
                <p>Yes! Sign in with the same Apple ID on all your devices (iPhone, iPad) and your data will sync automatically via iCloud.</p>

                <h4>How do I delete a patient?</h4>
                <p>Go to Patients → Swipe left on the patient → Delete → Confirm. This permanently removes the patient, all their appointments, and all associated photos.</p>

                <h4>Why can't I take photos?</h4>
                <p>DentalMate requires camera permission. Go to Settings → DentalMate → Camera → Allow. Note: Camera features don't work in the iOS Simulator — you need a physical iPhone.</p>

                <h4>How do I export my data?</h4>
                <p>Currently, data is stored in your iCloud account. We're working on export features for future updates. Your data remains accessible as long as you're signed into your Apple ID.</p>

                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

                <h4>My data isn't syncing between devices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verify you're signed into the same Apple ID on both devices</li>
                    <li>Check: Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Toggle DentalMate ON</li>
                    <li>Ensure you have an active internet connection</li>
                    <li>iCloud Keychain sync can take 1-2 minutes on first setup</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Notifications aren't appearing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the Notifications tab and tap "Allow Notifications"</li>
                    <li>Check iOS Settings → Notifications → DentalMate → Allow Notifications</li>
                    <li>Verify the appointment is scheduled for today or tomorrow (48-hour window)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>App is crashing or freezing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Force quit the app: Swipe up from the bottom and swipe DentalMate away</li>
                    <li>Restart your iPhone</li>
                    <li>Make sure you're running the latest version from the App Store</li>
                    <li>If the issue persists, contact support (see below)</li>

                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

                <div class="last-updated">
                    <strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 20, 2026
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> We don't collect, access, or share your data. Everything stays on your device and your personal iCloud account. No servers, no tracking, no third parties.
                </div>

                <h3>1. Overview</h3>
                <p>DentalMate is a patient management application designed for dental professionals. Your privacy and the confidentiality of your patient data is our highest priority. This privacy policy explains how we handle data in our app.</p>

                <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>DentalMate stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patient names, dates of birth, phone numbers, and group assignments</li>
                    <li>Appointment dates, times, procedure types, and notes</li>
                    <li>Clinical notes (encrypted with AES-256-GCM)</li>
                    <li>Patient profile photos and clinical documentation photos</li>
                    <li>Practice statistics (calculated locally from your data)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                <p><strong>We do not operate any servers or cloud infrastructure.</strong> Specifically, we do NOT collect, access, or transmit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ Analytics or usage data</li>
                    <li>❌ Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
                    <li>❌ Location data</li>
                    <li>❌ Diagnostic or crash reports (beyond Apple's standard opt-in)</li>
                    <li>❌ Any data to third-party servers or services</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your data never leaves your personal devices. We cannot access it, and we do not want to.</p>

                <h3>4. How Data Is Stored</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored in your device's secure app container using Apple's SwiftData framework</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Clinical notes are encrypted end-to-end using AES-256-GCM encryption before storage</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption Keys:</strong> Stored in the iOS Keychain, which is hardware-secured and isolated from the app sandbox</li>
                    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Stored in the app's private Documents folder, inaccessible to other apps</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. iCloud Sync</h3>
                <p>If you enable iCloud on your device, DentalMate uses Apple's iCloud service to sync your data across your personal devices signed into the same Apple ID:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What syncs:</strong> Patient records, appointments, encrypted notes, encryption keys (via iCloud Keychain), and photos (via iCloud Backup)</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple using industry-standard protocols</li>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Only you can access this data on devices signed into your Apple ID</li>
                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can disable sync at any time in iOS Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud</li>
                    <li><strong>Our Access:</strong> We have zero access to your iCloud data — it's managed entirely by Apple</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Data Sharing</h3>
                <p><strong>We do not share your data with anyone.</strong> Period.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No third-party analytics services</li>
                    <li>No advertising networks</li>
                    <li>No data brokers or aggregators</li>
                    <li>No AI training or machine learning companies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The only "sharing" is when YOU explicitly use iOS share features (e.g., sharing a clinical photo via Messages or Email) — this is controlled entirely by you through iOS.</p>

                <h3>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
                <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Delete Individual Records:</strong> Swipe to delete patients, appointments, or photos within the app</li>
                    <li><strong>Delete All Local Data:</strong> Uninstall the app from your device</li>
                    <li><strong>Delete iCloud Data:</strong> Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups → [Your Device] → DentalMate → Delete Data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We cannot delete your data because we don't have access to it.</p>

                <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>DentalMate is intended for use by healthcare professionals aged 18 and older. The app may store information about minor patients as part of clinical records, but it does not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13.</p>

                <h3>9. Security Measures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>AES-256-GCM encryption for all clinical notes</li>
                    <li>Encryption keys stored in iOS Keychain with hardware-backed security</li>
                    <li>App sandbox isolation prevents access from other apps</li>
                    <li>No network transmission of patient data (except via your iCloud account, managed by Apple)</li>
                    <li>No embedded third-party SDKs or trackers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>10. Compliance and Professional Use</h3>
                <p><strong>HIPAA and Professional Regulations:</strong> DentalMate provides encryption and security features designed to help healthcare professionals protect patient data. However, you (the healthcare provider) are ultimately responsible for ensuring your use of the app complies with applicable regulations including HIPAA, GDPR, and local healthcare privacy laws.</p>
                <p><strong>We recommend:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enabling device passcode or biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)</li>
                    <li>Not sharing your device with unauthorized individuals</li>
                    <li>Following your practice's data security and retention policies</li>
                    <li>Obtaining appropriate patient consents for data storage</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>11. In-App Purchases</h3>
                <p>DentalMate offers optional tips (in-app purchases) to support development. These purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect payment information — Apple handles all transactions. Purchase records are stored in your Apple ID account, not by us.</p>

                <h3>12. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted at this URL with a new "Effective Date" at the top. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

                <h3>13. Your Rights</h3>
                <p>Because we do not collect or store your data on our servers, traditional data rights (access, portability, deletion requests) are handled directly by you through your device and iCloud account. You have full control at all times.</p>

                <h3>14. Legal Basis (GDPR)</h3>
                <p>For users in the European Union: We process personal data (stored locally on your device) based on your consent and our legitimate interest in providing healthcare management tools. You can withdraw consent at any time by deleting data from the app or uninstalling it.</p>
